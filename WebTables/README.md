# Tables

In the world of analytics, you always need more data that only someone else knows. Getting that data from them is difficult. You can have them provide it in excel, but then you get into spreadmart hell.

With this project, you just create the tables you need and in a single webpage the people with the data can easily update/delete (and hopefully soon, insert) records.

Rght now this only works against MSSQL
